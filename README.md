MistbornMaze is an exciting real-time multiplayer game developed with Godot Engine and C#. Set in the Mistborn universe, players venture into a maze filled with traps and enemies, competing to escape.

## Introduction 🌫️

Under a perpetually cloudy sky, the maze stretches out like an endless cemetery. You walk among broken tombstones and moss-covered mausoleums, while the mist dances on the ground, hiding what your eyes don't want to see. The faint light filtering through the clouds casts long, distorted shadows, making the cemetery seem alive. The air is thick with heavy silence, broken only by the occasional crunch of your steps or the distant echo of something crawling in the dark. Here, among the forgotten dead, every path seems to lead deeper into despair.

Hidden among the crypts and graves are five fragments of Lerasium, glowing with an otherworldly light, as if they don't belong in this world. This mineral is not only the key to your escape but also the reward for your survival. But you're not alone. Something is following you—perhaps the maze itself, perhaps the echoes of those who failed before. As the fragments draw near, so does the danger. In this place of eternal rest, only one will leave the realm of the dead. The rest will stay here, forever.
